To add the actual icon:

2. Extract the icon from Code.exe or download the official icon
3. Save it as 'vscode_icon.png' in this directory (replace this .txt file)
4. The icon should be at least 48x48 pixels (PNG format)

Recommended size: 64x64 or 128x128 pixels

The application will automatically extract the icon from Code.exe if this file is not present.
